# Web based Service for task automation using MERN

Most of our activites are spread across the internet, across different services like facebook, gmail, twitter. These are different in their working and their services. We thorugh this app plan to achieve an integration among these services to create a trigger-action relationship between them, i.e, when something (trigger) happens on some service, then it creates an action to another (or same) service.

**Note**: MVP and other features would be added soon.
**Currently in Development**
